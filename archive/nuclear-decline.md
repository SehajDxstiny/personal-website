**BTW NUCLEAR IS ONE OF THE SAFTEST ENERGY SOURCE!**

![btw nuclear is one of the safest energy sources out there. ](/images/image7.png)

1. good old economics - demand reduced in the early 70s because "arab oil embargo" increased the oil prices 4 times. So recession, and electricity demand reduced. Utility companies were building new plants, and got scared who will use all this energy, and some of the biggest folks who used this energy were oil companies like refineries, who had no oil to refine. And so till '78 new plants stopped, and people cancelled orders. Its interesting how oil price -> increased but nuclear's demand decreased. Nuclear plants are very behemoth of projects, multi-billion and multi-decade long projects, (and apparently plants got bigger because of economics of scale, where it was cheaper to build bigger plants in terms of output gain). 

2. AEC (atomic energy commission):  over promising the safety ("1 in billion"), while covering up some failures. And when some failures do happen, it gives the "decels" a clear chance to hit on them, which led them to loose public trust. 

3. Environmentalists (decels): Degrowth, (population bomb) [small is beautiful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Is_Beautiful), fear about nuclear bombs (rightly so maybe) but ignorance that nuclear energy and weapons cannot be more different.

4. Regulations - NEEPA and NRC, overthinking about safety issues. 

5. "Disasters": Meltdowns like fukushima, chernobyl or three mile island CAME after all of the above. So the public reaction was much more exaggerated, as it would have happened if all was good before. Much more harmful incidents have happened in industries like oil, and but no one knows about them. Oh and BTW, chernobyl CONTINUED to produce electricity for 14 years after the meltdown, and there was no injury in other 2 meltdowns.
