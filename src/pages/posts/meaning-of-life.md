For those who don’t know, [factorio](http://factorio.com) is a game where you build and maintain massive factories in order to build a rocket to get out of the planet you crash landed in. 

Playing factorio in real life, for us, means being a definite optimist, understanding ways of creating, doing hard tech at scale, working _with_ (intelligent) machines, using the means of abundant energy, organizing intelligence to advance civilization using the means of capitalism, by arranging atoms in novel and useful ways, letting only nature and free markets validate our conjectures, embracing universal knowledge-creation principles of fallibilism, understanding nature and society, building the best factories in our solar system, and knowing that any good system takes (a very long) time to build. 

Factories are physical places in spacetime which produce extraordinary value from resources at hands, and make lives better (resources in, products out). The capability of our factories determine the capability of our civilization. And it is the backbone of any advancing civilization. It might be a good time to spend human-flops in this area because of the great stagnation. And because manufacturing is hard. Much harder than we think we can even imagine right now. Good.

But how can something so mechanical, devoid of any divinity or supernatural certainty be the answer to one of the most important philosophical and historical questions which steered human civilization to where it is, directly, that is, the meaning of life? 

The core idea, at the heart of striving to build factories, is, more generally, that of progress. And progress is important because it allows us to find better answers to better questions, and allows the diminishment of scarcity. It allows us (by giving freedom) to dive deeper into more creative and important objective/moral truths. 

And what religious, life or moral philosophy _fundamentally_ allows, supports and optimizes the idea of vast technological transformations? The idea of building a home on mars or unheard longevity? I want to live forever and travel the universe. What optimizes _for_ _that_?

The ideas of techno-progress with a touch of fallibilism and optimism does. The richest man in the world uses the same computers as a middle class person. World class products for everyone, making everyone richer. Factories make that possible. The road from starting agriculture to building rockets, is almost entirely the story of building better hardware, and thus, better factories. 

So earth is about to complete its revolution around the sun, which is our 19th one. This is a snapshot of principles we want to be guided with. The main reason behind this is to make sure we don’t acclimate to the ways of mediocrity, and lose our optimism in the future. This is a culmination of years of exploration we’ve been doing to find better ways of thinking about work, life, society and the universe - but it is in no way exhaustive, and we will be adding more things as we go through life.

1. Fallibilism and intellectual humility. The idea that one can be wrong about anything at anytime and one _needs_ to strive to get better explanations. Conjecture and refutation. Evolution does that, so who are we not to? 

2) The conditioning of society prohibits us from seeing the world clearly. Most of the systems and most of the people are wrong. There are better ways. It is a good rule of thumb to assume all conventional wisdom is flawed, and work backwards from it. How to think differently?

3. (Definite) optimism is essential, is necessary. To be excited about the world, life and future seems a very rare quality. Lack of knowledge is the root of all evils. Problems are inevitable. Problems are soluble. 

4) On being silently indefinite pessimists. Plainly going through life as dictated by most societies is inherently and necessarily pessimistic, because it doesn’t involve novelty, the will to explore and the thrills of adventure. 

5. Advanced tech to solve problems is the way. Better type writer vs word processor. _When there is a gold rush, don’t make shovels_. Make a 3D printed, solar powered, end-to-end ai, robot which uses RL to do the digging for you. And then wonder how you could transmute cheap metals into gold.

6) Science fiction is good for expanding one’s thinking horizons. 

7. Create massive value for civilization, and make sure to capture some of it. That is done by solving problems, at scale. “Find someone with money who needs a problem solved and solve it, repeat” - Casey Handmer 

8) Do you know how the world really works? Be deserving by the virtue of knowing a lot. Understand the world deeply. Impactful people know a lot of things which are difficult to know. Be skilled - everything begins from here. You probably can’t change the world unless you understand it well enough. 

9. Curiosity as a philosophy is good. 

10) Humanity is still in its infancy, as the traditions of enlightenment have just started. It could lead to the beginning of infinity, if we manage to preserve the values of error correction. 

11. We want to be applied scientists. We want to be able to try to solve the hardest technical problems in our 30s.

12) Build technology, and don’t lie. Don’t fake it till you make it, be honest and hope you make it. – geohot

13. “There are enough smart people working on every possible permutation of code that your particular marginal addition is unlikely to accelerate the future by more than a few weeks, maybe months.” - Casey Handmer. Something hits different when we hold our playstation controller, feel that carefully designed macbook or watch that mammoth of a machine fly into orbit. Work on hardware!

14) Building for changing wealth distribution i.e SQL entries is one thing, but doing novel things which can’t be done by others to move civilization forward is another. Something of somewhere is nothing of nowhere.  Competition is for losers. Build monopolies. “The world is full of mediocre, middle-of-the-road companies creating mediocre, middle-of-the-road crap” - Tony Fadell. 

15. What to work on is really important, and we need to work on the hardest possible things. Popper said “The best thing that can happen to a human being us to find a problem, to fall in love with that problem, and to live trying to solve that problem, unless another problem even more lovable appears” .  Nietzsche said “I know of no better life purpose than to perish in attempting the great and the impossible.”

16. Be in the room with the smartest people on the planet, around alpha vibes -  meaning future secrets and insights. A lot of things can flow from this. This is one of our biggest goals to optimize for and that is why we are building wayfarers. 

17) Where would you want to be when AGI comes? In a place where you’re waiting for it, and when it comes, your work gets enhanced by it. Create the infrastructure for it, so we welcome it with open arms. 

18. Technology + capital = progress 

19) Dear activists wont save me, capitalism will. Capitalism and free markets preserves the values of error correction. 

20. Learn from nature, not people. Free markets and nature are the only true validators. Physics and imagination are the only true limit. 

21) It’s probably good to assume we’re fools, even if we are not (though we probably are). 

22. (Formal) Education is not a substitute for thinking about the future. It is a certainty, a fake one

23) “What you read is who you are”. Read a lot. If you don’t read anything, you’re probably no one. 

24. Circumstances don't matter that much, possibilities do. And since there are infinite possibilities for things to create, for things to happen, life is infinitely great.

25) Just like (smart) aliens would understand a lot about our civilization’s technical capabilities after seeing starship or H100s - they could understand a lot about our society after playing The Last Of Us Part 2. 

26. Systems thinking. Understanding the big picture is helpful. Geopolitics and history for understanding nature of human organization and societies. Be aware if something is man-made or objective in nature. 

27) Talk to lots of people. Learning from those who’re there where you want to be (in a way) could be a cheat code. Your network is also a big contributing factor.

28. If someone watches everyone’s life from universe’s perspective, what would he say about yours? Are you crazy enough?

29) If someone gives you $100 billion, would you still be doing what you’re doing right now?

30. When was the last time you got excited like this? 

31) The great stagnation. We may have the early window to finally get back on track, because of the energy abundance on its way. Has it always been the [sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_S6DKqcU9M)? 

32. Pursue bold and crazy ideas but with good explanations backing them and insights into what things can happen (unlike galactic micronations or video game streaming). There is a distinction between publishing research papers that take civilizations nowhere versus creating self driving cars (with the science at the right time behind it).

33) Things take a long time to happen. The true discounted value of a company. A decade of work and the organizational capability becomes invaluable. Neuralink may become one of the most valuable companies in 20 years. Just like tesla became, in 20 years. 

34. Are you really solving problems? Most hypes, or products or whatever being worked on can be validated by how it affects/touches the end people. How it changes lives, affect the end user. Like the people living their lives, how it affects them. Web3 did not affect people. It is really hard to be useful. 

35) Certainty theory that people chase certainty, in everything. That we scorn the abstract. Confirmation, hindsight, attribution and survivorship biases. It is a good idea to meditate on what certainties are we basing our actions on.  By Nassim “we humans, facing limits of knowledge, and things we do not observe, the unseen and the unknown, resolve the tension by squeezing life and the world into crisp commoditized ideas, reductive categories, specific vocabularies, and prepackaged narratives, which, on the occasion, has explosive consequences”

36. Hard problems are like climbing out of a well. Money (entries in a sql database) can only take you so far. Keep climbing slowly, with no regressions, and slow & continuous improvement. - geohot

37) We’re driven by biology. At the core it is all primal-animal motivations. Social status, food, sex etc - the things we've been hardwired by evolution for millions and billions of years for survival. Become aware of this intrinsic part of ourselves. Animal mind vs Higher mind. The lesser the ‘apparent forms’ of these motivations hold meaning in our life, the better. 

38. Contrary to popular belief, capital is cheap. There is [too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJbvzkXiex8) much money in the world.

39) Most people don’t work hard, they just do easy and repetitive tasks over long periods of time. How many people would bang their heads on the wall, think deeply about problems, eat glass, get frustrated thinking about a solution? Solving difficult problems that requires one to think deeply like solving a math question often at work might be a good sign.  “Do it everyday, do it all day, do it for years” - Lex

40. Aesthetics are important. Don’t be cringe. 

41) No amount of money can buy you a trip to mars today. 

42. Explore - Ideas, places, people, thoughts, beliefs, and the world. For what can you do otherwise?

43) Software is still eating the world. Human intervention is going to get more and more automated. 

44. Play positive sum games. There are people working on every area imaginable for decades. You can’t compete with them on skill level, but perhaps channeling those skills in the right place hold more weight. 

45) Wealth allows you to allocate resources for the creation of new knowledge and more physical transformation. Wealth is not fixed pie. It grows larger and larger with the creation of new knowledge. 

46. If you consume content which everyone does, you will think like everyone. Allow your consumption of information to be different, niche. 

47) There are 8 billion people on the planet. Life seems black and white. There is no excuse to not try to do things like varda space, and decide this early on that yes we want to allocate capital, and build valuable companies. (yes excluding situations where people are too preoccupied to figure out how are they going to put next meal on the table) 

48. We are privileged. 

49) Local optimum of low expectation. Mediocrity or local maximas are alluring but evil. Meditate on how short life is, and the true place of oneself in the grand scheme of cosmic, luck, societal and evolutionary humility. 

50. There exists things like elden ring. 

51) Sorry, but most people are noobs. Not in intelligence, but in motivations. And most people don’t do great things, not because they can’t, but perhaps because they don’t want to. Because they don’t think they can. And that is so because the environment they grew up in didn’t give them cues otherwise.

52. A normal old school business does millions in business, while people go nowhere trying to build a B2B SaaS. 

53) People are not rational. 

54. “Two kinds of fools - those who take religion literally, and those who think it has no value”, “Buddha wasn’t a buddhist” - Naval 

55) Life is a playground. “Does god exist? The answer to this question has no significance to anyone’s life. It is a mere curiosity. More senseless concepts upon which to waste our precious existence, If he exists, your day-to-day existence is still you day-to-day existence. If he doesn’t exist, your day-to-day existence is still your day-to-day existence”- Kapil Gupta

56. Create more than you consume. The consumer class might be a plague. I admire those who make my life on this blue dot, a bit better. 

57) India seems to be good from both an opportunistic perspective and a cultural one.

58. Life is a playground. The meaning of life and does god exist are (probably) merely intellectual musings. The act of questioning holds more value than the answers. 

59) Meditate. Self is a thought which never goes away. Normalize silence, sit in a room with your thoughts and nothing else, magic happens when you give it space to exist. Meditation is learning by nature, not people. 

60. Cost of (wrong) information is too much. Information can create the perfect illusion of knowledge. Are you fitting data? And don’t read news. 

61) Bash against the norms. Be full of explorative energy. Do things that are not usually done. Be authentic. Radiate a free flowing blissful energy. Embrace childlike adventure.  Do not adhere to illusive rules of civility. Do not play along with the bullshit. Be a nuisance, poke life and the status quo. 

62. We are aware that most of our thoughts, principles and ideas are mostly influenced by what we see, and consume on the internet. We know that we only see the winners, that is, survivorship bias. 

63) Ok theory good, now do.
